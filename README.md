Backend API for a Polling / Voting application, built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.IO.

This service handles authentication, poll management, vote persistence, and real-time vote updates, using a cookie-based session model with access and refresh token rotation.

## Architecture Overview

The backend follows a modular Express architecture with real-time capabilities layered on top using Socket.IO.:

- REST APIs → authentication, polls, votes

- Socket.IO services → real-time vote broadcasting

- Routing → endpoint definitions

- Controllers → request handling and response shaping

- Middleware → authentication and centralized error handling

- Models → data schemas and business rules

- Utilities → shared helpers and abstractions

All security-sensitive logic (tokens, cookies, session validation) is handled exclusively on the server.

## Authentication & Session Strategy

This backend uses cookie-based authentication.

### Key characteristics

- Access and refresh tokens are issued by the server

- Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies

- Tokens are never exposed to frontend JavaScript

- Refresh tokens are persisted in the database and rotated on every use

### Token flow

1.  User logs in with credentials

2. Server issues:

	- Short-lived access token

	- Long-lived refresh token

3. Both tokens are set as HTTP-only cookies

4. Protected routes validate the access token

5. When access token expires:

	- Client calls /auth/refresh-token

	- Server validates and rotates refresh token

	- New cookies are issued

6. On logout:

	- Refresh token is removed from the database

	- Cookies are cleared

If refresh validation fails, the session is invalidated and the user must re-authenticate.

## Real-Time Voting with Socket.IO

This backend supports real-time vote updates using Socket.IO.

- Votes are persisted using REST APIs

- Vote updates are broadcast to connected clients via WebSockets

- Socket logic is isolated from REST controllers

Socket design

- events/ – defines poll-related socket events

- handlers/ – server-side event handling logic

- receivers/ – incoming socket event listeners

- service.js – Socket.IO server initialization

This separation keeps REST APIs stateless while enabling live UI updates.

## API Design Principles

- REST APIs for data mutation and validation

- WebSockets for real-time state propagation

- Stateless access tokens

- Refresh token rotation to prevent replay attacks

- Centralized error handling

- No token storage on the client

- Minimal surface area for authentication logic

## Folder responsibilities

- controllers/ – business logic and response formatting

- routes/ – endpoint definitions and middleware wiring

- middlewares/ – authentication guards and error handling

- models/ – MongoDB schemas and data rules

- socket/ – real-time event handling and broadcasting

- constants/ – shared configuration (cookie options)

- utils/ – reusable helpers and abstractions

## Authentication Middleware

Protected routes use a dedicated authentication middleware:

- Reads access token from HTTP-only cookies

- Verifies token signature and expiration

- Fetches user from database

- Attaches user to req.user

Refresh logic is intentionally not handled in middleware and remains centralized in the refresh endpoint.

## Live Polls API Behavior

- Polls are user-scoped

- User can:
	1. Create polls
	2. vote on polls

- Votes are:

	1. Persisted in MongoDB

	2. Broadcast in real-time to connected clients

- Server ensures:

	1. Valid voting rules

	2. Data integrity

	3. Authorization checks

All validation and authorization checks are enforced by the backend.

## Error Handling

All errors are handled by a single centralized error handler.

Handled cases include:

- MongoDB duplicate key errors

- Mongoose validation errors

- Invalid ObjectId errors

- JWT verification errors

- Malformed JSON payloads

- Custom ApiError instances

Error responses are sanitized in production to avoid leaking internal details.

## Environment Configuration

Only an example file is committed:

```bash
.env.example
```

Required environment variables include:

- NODE_ENV

- MONGO_URI

- ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET

- REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET

All secrets are managed server-side.

## Frontend Integration

This backend is consumed by a separately deployed frontend.

- Frontend Repository: https://github.com/vipulsawant8/live-polls-frontend

- Frontend Stack: React, Redux Toolkit, Axios, Socket.IO client

- Auth Integration: Cookie-based sessions with automatic refresh

- Real-Time Updates: Socket.IO

The frontend does not manage tokens and relies entirely on server-side session handling.

## Security Notes

- Tokens stored only in HTTP-only cookies

- Refresh tokens rotated on every use

- Logout invalidates refresh token in database

- No sensitive data returned in API responses

- Error messages sanitized in production

This backend is intended for portfolio and demo usage, not high-risk production systems.
